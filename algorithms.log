! Improper \spacefactor.
<recently read> \spacefactor 
                             
l.9 ... \in \R^{\Ps}$ with $\mat{h}_{\Ps}(u) = \H_
                                                  f(u,\epsilon)$.
You can refer to \spacefactor only in horizontal mode;
you can refer to \prevdepth only in vertical mode; and
neither of these is meaningful inside \write. So
I'm forgetting what you said and using zero instead.

! Please use \mathaccent for accents in math mode.
\add@accent ...@spacefactor \spacefactor }\accent 
                                                  #1 #2\egroup \spacefactor ...
l.9 ... \in \R^{\Ps}$ with $\mat{h}_{\Ps}(u) = \H_
                                                  f(u,\epsilon)$.
I'm changing \accent to \mathaccent here; wish me luck.
(Accents are not the same in formulas as they are in text.)

A left brace was mandatory here, so I've put one in.
You might want to delete and/or insert some corrections
so that I will find a matching right brace soon.

! You can't use `\spacefactor' in math mode.
\add@accent ...}\accent #1 #2\egroup \spacefactor

Sorry, but I'm not programmed to handle this case;
I'll just pretend that you didn't ask for it.
If you're in the wrong mode, you might be able to
return to the right one by typing `I}' or `I$' or `I\par'.
